TableEdit - a set of extensions to create and edit mediawiki tables.

TableEdit officially lives on MediaWiki at 
    [ http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TableEdit ]
I suggest reading the documentation there first, as these files tend
to not get updated regularly. The wiki pages also possibly have notes
and updates from other users that you might find helpful. Please leave
comments on the talk page and one of the developers will try and get 
back to you. 

TODO:
installer needs rewriting.

----------------
version 0.82

Added features:
	Add multiple rows from the web interface
	Templated tables can now have custom help text in 4 places:
		help1 - below the source page name on all views
		help2 - below the source page name on the navigation view
		help3 - at the bottom of the navigation view
		help4 - at the end of the row editing view
Bug fixes:
	Imported wikitext for help is now parsed into HTML
	
----------------
version 0.8

TableEdit now comes with a few new features:

[1]	You will find a new class for loading data directly into the tables. This class is defined in
	class.loader.php. It comes with an example usage script named loader.sample.php. A cursory definition 
	of the input is defined at < http://blog.gmod.org/tableedit_round_trip_thoughts >, although this 
	may change.
	
	The loader class *should* run smoothly with instances of TableEdit that still use an external 
	database. However, it is strongly recomended that you update the schema into the MediaWiki database.
	
[2] 	The Updater. This script will take an external database and move it into the MW schema. It assumes that 
	you do not have TableEdit tables in the MW schema already. Call this script by:
	
		php5 update_schema.php -w /path/to/your/wiki [ -u [ -p ] ]
		
	It is important to note that AdminSettings.php must exist and that the admin-user must have at least 
	basic privileges along with CREATE and FILE privileges on both databases. Alternately, you can use the -u and -p
	flags to specify a mysql user to use (typically one with root privileges.) 

[3] 	Other improvements such as the ability to move columns, to add and delete metadata for a row or box,
	better integration with the Mediawiki functions, and better code structure. TableEdit has been heavily 
	modified, and backwards compatibility isn't guaranteed. 

[4]	TableEdit now has a system to find its tables from the wikitext and compare that to what's in the database.
	
----------------
version 0.75

IMPORTANT - this version removes hardcoding of wikibox_db. The db name should be set using the global variable $wgTableEditDatabase, which can be set to different databases for different wikis.
Changed to remove the intermediate step of having to click on Create Table Here.  Just inserts the Table.
Changed bottom row with edit link to allow sortable.js in MW to work.
row object updates its row_id on db_save_row()
more parsing of the wiki markup in the TableEdit special page.
escaped slashes and \n are converted.
Changed user rights test so that unauth users can play with the interface, but can't save back to the wiki.  
This allows people to at least try the interface.

----------------
version 0.6

Special page now displays template expansions, e.g if the heading style is determined by a wiki template, then it gets used 
Added hook and extension, TableEditCreationLinks.php to alter the "Create Table Here" text, depending on the template used
changed how box_uid is done. Wasn't unique enough before
changed SpecialTableEdit.body.php organization to be more useful for maintenance scripts
more misc bug fixes.
Inactivate headings edit link when templates are in use.

----------------
version 0.5

bug fixes for mediawiki 1.10.0

----------------
version 0.4

bug fixes

----------------
version 0.3

Schema changes.  You need to reinstall the schema to use TableEdit.  You may lose some existing tables (remember that this extension is still experimental).

Changed how boxes are identified to handle imports and page moves better

misc. bug fixes

Tables are now saved into the wiki in a less compressed form. This was necessary to allow content that breaks over more than one line, and to support bulleted lists as data.

Template handling changed
	There are now two ways to represent a table template
	1. The old way, a return-delimited list is assumed to be a list of headings.
	2. XML style.  Attributes for the table are wrapped in XML-like tags.
		<headings></headings> for headings
		<style></style> for heading style
		<type></type> for horizontal (default) or vertical (1) orientation
	
	
	3. Added support for special kinds of editable cells in the Template-defined headings. This should work with either the old or XML-style templates
	Syntax:
		Heading||column_name|rule
		
		rule syntax
			text					to use input type=text instead of textarea
			select|1|2|etc 			make a pulldown menu with choices 1, 2, etc
			lookup|sql|field		sql statement|name of field to return
									sql statements use {{{column_name}}} in place of specific fields
			
			example: Aspect||aspect|lookup|SELECT namespace from go_archive.term WHERE go_id = '{{{1}}}' ORDER BY term_update DESC LIMIT 1|namespace
		
		currently available calcs
			split        			split|delimiter|x|y|z 
									where x,y, and z are integers indicating which parts of the split to join into the result
			reqcomplete				reqcomplete|column_name|column_name|column_name...  
									where column names are required fields.
									returns "complete" or "required field needed"

Started moving message text to the i18n file.  Needs more work!

Added a hook to allow other extensions to do things to the table before it is saved back to the wiki page.  Example included in the distribution.

----------------

Changed persistence to use $_SESSION instead of putting serialized data all over the page.
Edit conflict detection based on modification timestamp

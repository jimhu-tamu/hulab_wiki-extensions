== Column rules in TableEdit.==

TableEdit includes a Hook to allow customization of the user interface for specific fields in tables. 
Originally, TableEdit had code for these in the methods TableEdit::apply_column_rules. As our use of
TableEdit became more complex, we added a hook to allow TableEdit to be extended with new column rules.

In defining templated tables, the syntax for each line in <headings/> is

	Display_heading||field_var_name|column_rule|column_rule_option_1|column_rule_option_2 ... etc.
	
	Display_heading:	what is shown in the wiki page
	field_var_name:  	a hash key assigned to the data
	column_rule:    	the name of the column rule to run
	options..."     	data passed to the column rule, e.g. menu options

By default, TableEdit assumes that the user will edit content in cells in a table using a textarea text
entry field. Column rules that are still built into TableEdit include

	select       	pull down menu of options
	checkbox     	checkboxes of the options. Displays selected items as bulleted list
	text        	single line input
	timestamp   	timestamp as date("Y-m-d" $row->timestamp)
	foreign     	lookup from another table. More specific column rules are probably better than this
	             	general method
	calc        	calculations	


This directory includes a mix of older column rules and newer ones that take advantage of an abstract 
class for making new column rules. Eventually, we plan to deprecate the older ones and/or replace them
with the newer type.

== Writing new column rules ==
A new column rule extension should include the following:

	an entry in column_rule_settings.php to register the column_rule name and assign the code that will handle it.
	
	examples
	
		$te_column_rules = array(
			'test_rule' => $dir . 'test_rule.php',
			'dbxref' => $dir . 'dbxref.php',
			'multifield' => $dir . 'multifield.php',
			...
		);	
	
	an object that extends class TableEdit_Column_rule. column rule class names must be in the format "ecTableEdit_".$tag.
	for example, the test_rule column rule is handled by class ecTableEdit_test_rule. Exceptions need to be coded into column_rules_settings.
	
	The new ecTableEdit_ class should overload two methods:
	
		function make_form_row(){
		
		}
		
	This method creates the part of the HTML form that is used in the row editing view
	
	and (optionally)
	
		function show_data(){
			return $this->col_data;
		}
	
	This method manipulates how the data is displayed and saved in the database.
	
	See test_rule.php for an example.
